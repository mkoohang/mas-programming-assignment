# National Parks API üå≤
This is a backend API for accessing and favoriting national parks from the National Park Services API.

## Features ‚≠êÔ∏è
- User accounts
- JWT Token Authentication
- National Park Service API Integration
- Favoriting and unfavoriting parks
- Wish lists for keeping track of favorite parks

## Tech Stack üêç
- Flask (Python)
- MongoDB

## Run ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

### Live
The app is currently running live at https://powerful-wildwood-07865.herokuapp.com. You can use a REST client such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
to make HTTP requests or write scripts in your language of choice. Instructions for access are listed under 'Instructions'.

### Local
Running this app with a local MongoDB database is quite difficult, so all you'll have to do 
is connect to the live database we are running rather than create your own. We provide the URI
to it in an environment variable below.

To run this app locally, you need to follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
2. Download or clone the repository
3. `cd` in to the repository and create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv ./venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment `source ./venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Export the following environment variables in your terminal or change the values in the `create_app()` function in the app.py file from `os.environ.get()` to the values listed here. These values are 
included in the write up for the assignment rather than this README for security purposes. 
Please refer to my written submission for the values of these environment variables. 

Example for how to export: type `export MONGODB_URI=valueinwriteup`. Repeat this process for all 6 variables shown below and replace 'somevalue' with the value given in the write up submission. DO NOT put quotes around the value.

Example for replacing values in 'app.py': Change `application.config['MONGO_URI'] = os.environ.get('MONGODB_URI')` to `application.config['MONGO_URI'] = "valueinwriteup"`. MAKE SURE to include the quotes around the value so that it's a string.

Repeat either of these processes for each of the variables below.
    1. MONGODB_URI=?
    2. FLASK_ENV=?
    3. DEBUG=?
    4. TESTING=?
    5. SECRET_KEY=?
    6. NPS_API_KEY=?
7. Run the app in the terminal `python app.py`

The app should now be running. Follow the rest of the instructions to interact with it.

## Instructions üìú
1. Register with the API through the `rest/register` endpoint
2. Login to the API through the `rest/login` endpoint
3. Use the API token returned to you from the login or registration endpoint to access 
all other endpoints

## Endpoints ‚ö°Ô∏è

- LIVE base_url = https://powerful-wildwood-07865.herokuapp.com
- LOCAL base_url = (check your terminal when you do step #7 in the 'Run' section to see what
address the app is running on; it's most likely 127.0.0.1:5000)
